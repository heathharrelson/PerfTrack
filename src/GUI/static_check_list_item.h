//! \brief This class is a QCheckListItem that the user cannot check or
//! uncheck -- it can only be changed programmatically.
//!
//! !Also, it stores the default text in column 1 rather than column 0,
//! so column 0 contains the checkbox only.
class StaticCheckListItem : public Q3CheckListItem {
public:
	StaticCheckListItem( Q3ListView * lv, const QString& t )
		: Q3CheckListItem( lv, QString(), Q3CheckListItem::CheckBox )
	{	setText( 1, t ); }

	//! Return the default text (from column 1)
	virtual QString text() const
	{	return Q3ListViewItem::text( 1 ); }

protected:
	//! Reimplemented version does nothing in response to user click.
	//! The box's state can still be changed with setOn()
	virtual void activate()
